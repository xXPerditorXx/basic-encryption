Encrypt a text with a simple Caesar-based cipher. Written in Python 3.9

I wrote the Caesar-based encryption as a little hobby to get more comfortable with Python and to gain more experience in the subject.

I'm always open for suggestions, so if anyone has any, please let me know.

Example:
```Text to Encrypt: That's a test text!

Encryption-Key: "P :K*N(}DrX€FvM°i.'BZ4#cjytGO~uY>0p1=/7kq@LSn$;R<V6?Q,gzÄ9lxA+Höµ{w!Ue§EfWm|ÖdashJ\ü^I3_]82C%5bÜ)o[&Tä-
Encrypted: n("'s.-"-'K.'-'K#'!
Key: "P :K*N(}DrX€FvM°i.'BZ4#cjytGO~uY>0p1=/7kq@LSn$;R<V6?Q,gzÄ9lxA+Höµ{w!Ue§EfWm|ÖdashJ\ü^I3_]82C%5bÜ)o[&Tä-
Decrypted: That's a test text!

Process finished with exit code 0
