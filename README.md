# Introduction
Encrypt a text with a simple Caesar-based cipher.

**Please keep in mind that this is not a strong encryption and can be easily decrypted by anyone at any time. So please use a proper encryption if you really want to use it for communication over the internet.**

I wrote the Caesar-based encryption as a little hobby to get more comfortable with Python and to gain more experience in the subject.
I'm always open for suggestions, so if anyone has any, please let me know.
This code was written in Python 3.9 but I think you can use 3.5 - 3-9 too.

# Usage
Depending on your Operating System use `python encryption.py` or `python3 encryption.py`

First, after `Text to Encrypt: `, enter the text you want to encrypt.
After that the script will give you the encrypted message and the corresponding key.

Now you have an encrypted message with the corresponding key.

If you now want to decrypt the message again, just enter the key that the script gave you after `Decryption-Key: `.
The encrypted message is already in the script's cache, so you only need to enter the key that was given to you.

And now you have successfully encrypted as well as decrypted a text.

# Example
`Text to Encrypt: This is a simple script to encrypt and decrypt a message.`

`Encryption-Key: "padXYnD€S0#K(*9µ{v:P;kbOTÖ<_jGVm>BZ6gRWC58L+l1M$Us.iHyf[§2J|3}x%)?üä=Nqö7]4,I°Äc~FEQ&w/u!-^tzrAÜ\h@o'e `

`Encrypted: lD€v €v " v€K9#X va{€9: :* X(a{O9: "(d dXa{O9: " KXvv"nXA`

`Decryption-Key: "padXYnD€S0#K(*9µ{v:P;kbOTÖ<_jGVm>BZ6gRWC58L+l1M$Us.iHyf[§2J|3}x%)?üä=Nqö7]4,I°Äc~FEQ&w/u!-^tzrAÜ\h@o'e `

`Decrypted: This is a simple script to encrypt and decrypt a message.`
