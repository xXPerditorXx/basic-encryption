# Introduction
Encrypt a text with a simple Caesar-based cipher.

**Please keep in mind that this is not a strong encryption and can be easily decrypted by someone at any time. So please use a proper encryption if you really want to use it for communication over internet.**

I wrote the Caesar-based encryption as a little hobby to get more comfortable with Python and to gain more experience in the subject.
I'm always open for suggestions, so if anyone has any, please let me know.
This code was written in Python 3.9

# Usage
Depending on your Operating System use `python encryption.py` or `python3 encryption.py`

First, after `Text to Encrypt:`, enter the text you want to encrypt.


# Example
`Text to Encrypt: That's a test text!`

`Encryption-Key: "P :K*N(}DrX€FvM°i.'BZ4#cjytGO~uY>0p1=/7kq@LSn$;R<V6?Q,gzÄ9lxA+Höµ{w!Ue§EfWm|ÖdashJ\ü^I3_]82C%5bÜ)o[&Tä-`

`Encrypted: n("'s.-"-'K.'-'K#'!`

`Key: "P :K*N(}DrX€FvM°i.'BZ4#cjytGO~uY>0p1=/7kq@LSn$;R<V6?Q,gzÄ9lxA+Höµ{w!Ue§EfWm|ÖdashJ\ü^I3_]82C%5bÜ)o[&Tä-`

`Decrypted: That's a test text!`

`Process finished with exit code 0`
